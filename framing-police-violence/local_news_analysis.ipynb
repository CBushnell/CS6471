John Kades.\\nThe pursuit began about 9:30 p.m. when L.A. County sheriffâs deputies apparently tried to stop Beaird, for driving recklessly.\\nBeaird finally crashed his silver Corvette into another car near Olympic Boulevard and Los Angeles Street about 10:30 p.m., following an hour-long pursuit that wound through South Gate, Huntington Park and South L.A., police said.\\nThree LAPD officers fired an estimated 22 times at Brian Beaird, who was unarmed. LAPD Chief Charlie Beck has put the officers on extended leave pending a final investigation, saying he was \"very concerned\" by the incident.\\nBeaird's father and brother stood outside LAPD headquarters a week after the shooting to announce that they had filed a $20-million claim against the city, a legal precursor required when suing a California government entity. An attorney for the Beaird family said that if the city doesn't reach an agreement, the family would pursue a federal wrongful-death suit.\\nBill Beaird described his youngest son as a disabled veteran who was discharged from the National Guard in 1988 after a botched surgery on a brain tumor. The surgery left his son with brain trauma, Beaird said. He could be paranoid, his father said, particularly about police.\\nJohn Beaird, the oldest of Bill Beaird's four sons, said his youngest brother \"made a lot of bad decisions that day.\" But, he said, the officers should not have shot him.\\n\"I can only imagine how terrified and alone he was in the last moments of his life,\" he said.\\nAn investigation into the shooting is underway. The department, which often provides written explanations for police shootings, has provided few details in the case.\\n-- Carla Rivera and Kate Mather\\nPhotos: Brian Newt Beaird, in an undated photo courtesy of his family | Police investigators at the scene where a silver Corvette crashed at the intersection of Olympic Blvd. and Los Angeles Street after a pursuit involving multiple police agencies.

       "      <td>\\n\\t\\tMan Killed After Police Pursuit in Corvette Had Schizophrenia: Friend\\t\\nA 51-year-old man shot to death by police after a wild police pursuit in a Corvette was mentally ill, paranoid and needed help, not lethal force, a lifelong friend of the man told NBC4 News.\\nBrian Beaird, 51, of Oceanside, chose to run from Los Angeles police officers on Friday because he suffered from schizophrenia, said friend Gilbert Vasquez. Watch: Questions Loom for LAPD Chief After Deadly Pursuit\\nLocal news from across Southern California\\nâHe heard voices so he probably saw the helicopter lights, the lights of the cops pursuing him,â Vasquez said. âIt scared the hell out of him.â\\nBeaird, a National Guard veteran, was identified as the man who swerved and sped through South Los Angeles for more than a hour before T-boning another car in an intersection and being shot by Los Angeles police at the end of the televised pursuit.\\nThe passengers in the other car were injured and are going to survive.\\nBeaird was unarmed.\\nThe pursuit began in Cudahy at 9:30 p.m., when deputies attempted to pull the driver over for drunk and reckless driving, officials said.\\nIn a press conference earlier Monday, LAPD Chief Charlie Beck said he would reserve comment until the investigation is complete.\\nâItâs very different to see something from 1,200 feet from a helicopter than 15 feet in the dust and the noise,â he said. âSo I reserve judgment.â\\nWhen asked if the sound of a non-lethal beanbag round being shot may have prompted other officers to start firing, Beck didnât answer directly. But he said that normally officers yell out to others to avoid firing in confusion.\\nâBefore an officer discharges a beanbag, the protocol is to loudly state, âbean bag ready! Bean bag ready!â so that everybody knows that the next detonation that they hear is not a gunshot,â he said.\\nThe LAPD has not yet said if a bean bag was deployed.\\nBut Vasquez insists his friend needed help and only non-lethal force should have been used.\\nâIt's outrageous that this police department chose to use a shoot to kill policy on him,â Vasquez said. âHe was unarmed. He didn't have anything.â</td>\n",
